General
-------
* Classes requiring repo actually only need the git command - this should be 
  changed to limit their access level and make things a little safer.
* Check for correct usage of id, ref and hexsha and define their meanings, 
  currently its not so clear what id may be in cases or not - afaik its usually 
  a sha or ref unless cat-file is used where it must be a sha
* Derive all Object like items like types such as Commit, Tag(Object), Tree, Blob
  from a common base. This allows to easily add __eq__, __ne__, __hash__ method 
  to make their use more comfortable and reduces code duplication.
* References like Tag(Reference), Heads and Remotes should have an own Base class
* Optimize type size by adding __slots__ ( at least ), which would also make sure 
  no one accidentally adds attributes to classes.
* Add more performance tests, see branch "performance_testing"

Configuration
-------------
* Native configuration handling, ideally without using git-config for it to keep 
  handling fast
  
Docs
----
Overhaul docs - check examples, check looks, improve existing docs

Remotes
-------
* Remote handling should be rather easy to implement as it is 'just' another 
  type of reference. It will be more work to do it right and allow convenient 
  access to the most common operations on remotes though.

Submodules
----------
* add submodule support

Testing
-------
* Upgrade to newer mock version >0.4 as the newer versions break support with 0.4

Tree
----
* Should return submodules during listing or deal with them in a way, see Submodules
